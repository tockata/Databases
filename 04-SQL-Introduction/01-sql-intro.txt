1. SQL or Structured Query Language and is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). SQL is standardized declarative language for manipulation of relational databases. It supports:
- Creating, altering, deleting tables and other DB objects
- searching, retrieving, inserting, modifying and deleting table data (data rows)

Most important commands in SQL:
CREATE TABLE - creates a new database table
ALTER TABLE - alters a database table
DROP TABLE - deletes a database table
SELECT - get data from a database table
UPDATE - change data in a database table
DELETE - remove data from a database table
INSERT INTO - insert new data in a database table

2. Data Manipulation Language (DML):
A data manipulation language (DML) is a family of computer languages including commands permitting users to manipulate data in a database. This manipulation involves inserting data into database tables, retrieving existing data, deleting data from existing tables and modifying existing data. DML is mostly incorporated in SQL databases.

3. Data definition language (DDL):
A data definition language or data description language (DDL) is a syntax similar to a computer programming language for defining data structures, especially database schemas.
