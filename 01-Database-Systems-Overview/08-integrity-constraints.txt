Integrity constraints ensure data integrity in the database tables. Enforce data rules which cannot be violated.

Primary key constraint:
- Ensures that the primary key of a table has unique value for each table row
Unique key constraint:
- Ensures that all values in a certain column (or a group of columns) are unique
Foreign key constraint:
- Ensures that the value in given column is a key from another table
Check constraint:
- Ensures that values in a certain column meet some predefined condition
