A primary key is a column or group of columns that uniquely identify a row. Every table should have a primary key. And a table cannot have more than one primary key.

A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table whose values must have matching values in the primary key of another (or the same) table. A foreign key is said to reference its primary key. Foreign keys are a mechanism for maintaining data integrity.

Difference between Primary Key & Foreign Key
Primary Key:
-Primary key uniquely identify a record in the table;
-Primary Key can't accept null values;
-By default, Primary key is clustered index and data in the database table is physically organized in the sequence of clustered index;
-We can have only one Primary key in a table.

Foreign Key:
-Foreign key is a field in the table that is primary key in another table;
-Foreign key can accept multiple null value;
-Foreign key do not automatically create an index, clustered or non-clustered. You can manually create an index on foreign key;
-We can have more than one foreign key in a table.
