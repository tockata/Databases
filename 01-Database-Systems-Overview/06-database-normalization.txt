Database normalization is the process of organizing the attributes and tables of a relational database to minimize data redundancy.

The Normalisation Process:
Normalisation is a data analysis technique to design a database system. It allows the database designer to understand the current data structures within an organisation. Furthermore, it aids any future changes and enhancements to the system.

The end result of normalisation is a set of entities, which removes unnecessary redundancy (ie duplication of data) and avoids the anomalies discussed earlier.

Normalisation follows a staged process that obeys a set of rules.

The steps of normalisation are:
- Select the data source and convert into an unnormalised table (UNF)
- Transform the unnormalised data into first normal form (1NF)
- Transform data in first normal form (1NF) into second normal form (2NF)
- Transform data in second normal form (2NF) into third normal form (3NF)

Occasionally, the data may still be subject to anomalies in third normal form. In this case, we may have to perform further transformations:
- Transform third normal form to Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)
- Transform Boyce-Codd normal form to fourth normal form (4NF)
- Transform fourth normal form to fifth normal form (5NF)
