Some of the benefits of normalization include the following:
Faster sorting and index creation.
A larger number of clustered indexes.
Narrower and more compact indexes.
Fewer indexes per table. This improves the performance of the INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
Fewer null values and less opportunity for inconsistency. This increases database compactness.
